    <p>Here are a few of my favourite shots from films. These are also related to what the film was expressing in that particular moment.</p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Marta, I am a software developer and, as you can see, I am a photography lover.<br>
        I studied illustration and a bit of cinema. I have always been attracted to capture or reproduce anything I find beautiful. And I see beauty in life all the time.<br>
        Even though I don't have a passion to create my own art (for the moment), I enjoy admiring other people's art and interpretations of life.<br>
